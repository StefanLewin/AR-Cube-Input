# AR Cube Input
This Unity project uses Vuforia to create an interactive AR experience with a physical cube. Each side of the cube is equipped with a target image that triggers a user interface projected onto the corresponding side. By rotating the cube, different buttons are highlighted. Lifting the cube or moving the camera closer executes the highlighted action, enabling seamless interaction with the AR environment.

## Editing the cube interfaces
A Scriptable Object handles the contents of the cube. (./CubeConfig) You can change the button contents and the background colors of each cube side.
